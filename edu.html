        <h3>Alarming Rise of Illiteracy Rates Worldwide</h3>
        <p>
            Recent events have caused a worrying reversal after world attempts of progress in improving literacy rates.
             Illiteracy, defined as the inability to read and write at a basic level, has begun to rise again.
              Often, those without access to basic learning opportunity, dropped out of school and never returned, increased the global illiteracy rates.

        <p>
            Several factors contributed to this growing crisis: Poverty and inequality, weak education system, and digital divide.
            Poverty and inequality still continue to prevent children from attending school, some don’t have enough money to afford extra expenses. Weak education system further disrupt learning, leaving millions without proper comprehension. Lastly, digital divide has widened educational inequalities, while a declining reading culture in some societies has resulted in students attending school but failing to develop essential literacy skills.

        </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            Consequences of rising illiteracy are far-reaching. Individuals have limited opportunities for employment and participation in democracy, societies have become more vulnerable to fake news or misinformation, and economies suffer from poorly skilled workforce guiding the community. 
            Reversing the rise in illiteracy requires coordinated global effort. We should all learn from our mistakes and vote for someone who have decent integral values. All should aim for a government who invest more in public education, teacher training, and inclusive learning programs.
             Illiteracy is not merely an educational issue – it is a global crisis with consequences. Addressing it urgently and collectively is essential to securing a more secure and informed future for all.

        <h3>OpenAI’s New Update to Promote Critical Thinking Among Students</h3>
        <p class="k0">
            In an effort to promote genuine learning and reduce AI cheating, OpenAI has released a new “study mode” for ChatGPT. However, the update was not enough to control the growing problem of students misusing AI in schoolworks. 
            The new update allows students to walk through concepts step-by-step, helping them think, explain, and understand rather than copy and paste answers.
        </p>

        <p class="k1">
            It allows students to become productive, as long as self-discipline is maintained. As the rising concerns about AI-assisted cheating in classroom catch their attention -- OpenAI created this feature in response to the said global issue. 
            Though, experts noted that these precautions can be bypassed easily. With just a few prompts, ChatGPT can go back with giving full answers, allowing students to generate homework answers they might submit as their own.
            Countless universities have been affected by the impact of AI. Cheating involving AI, arose as years pass and students, however, show no improvement. As professors appreciate the thought of updating a “study mode” feature, few remain doubtful that it will significantly reduce the cases of AI-related cheating world-wide.
            They argued that real change requires more than technology advancements – such as updated school policies, digital literacy education provided among individuals world-wide, and stricter guidelines on AI use.

        <p class="k2">
            Parents are advised to have an active involvement towards their young’s digital life. Parents should be responsible in controlling what their child view, do, and share.
            Assignments should promote critical thinking, and have comprehensible questions that are less vulnerable to AI-generated answers.
            Yet, concerns persist. Schools warn that without secure guards and student awareness, misuse may continue to rise, especially because AI tools have become more accessible. This will continue to threaten academic integrity and student’s overall learning experience.
