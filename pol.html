        <h3> The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee</h3>
        <p class="k0">
            The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee or the Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and investigations is considered one of the most powerful committees in the senator wide jurisdiction over investigations on graft, corruption, and matters of public interest.

            The committee has been investigating the alleged systematic and large-scale corruption in the flood control infrastructure projects. This includes the "ghost and substandard projects" and massive kickbacks. What makes this controversial is because of the alleged participation of the people from the executive and legislative branches of the government. 
            Hence, the integrity partiality and credibility of the committee is at stake. The billions of pesos budget allocated for the flood control project and the impact on public safety makes this more than just a financial scandal. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="k2">
            The committee's ability to conduct impartial investigations should not be compromised and be perceived as partisan or biased. 
            Reforms may follow on how infrastructure projects are awarded and monitored.
